## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Speak with authority and clarity
- Focus on outcomes and systems, not tasks and features
- Use "we architect" not "we create"
- Use "infrastructure" not "solutions"
- Use "growth systems" not "marketing services"
- Be specific about who you serve (mid-sized, established, scaling)
- Filter out tire-kickers with honest positioning

### Don't:
- Use generic agency language ("stunning designs", "passionate team")
- Promise outcomes without systems context
- Speak to startups or small businesses
- Use jargon without clarity
- Oversell — let the positioning filter

### Vocabulary Shifts
| Old (Generic Agency) | New (Systems Partner) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Services | Systems |
| Projects | Infrastructure |
| Campaigns | Growth Systems |
| Websites | Platforms |
| Design | Architecture |
| Launch | Deploy |
| Clients | Partners |
| Deliverables | Outcomes |
| Creative | Strategic |
| Solutions | Systems |
